## Hello! I'm Hambaka | 你好！我叫Hambaka

I'm not a developer, my hobby is doing localization/translation (Simplified Chinese) for games in free time.

我并不是开发者，我业余爱好也就做点游戏相关的翻译，非常佛系。

## The games I have translated in the past: （我曾经翻译过的游戏：）
**Official Simplified Chinese localization (官方简体中文）**
- [Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight](http://store.steampowered.com/app/428550)
   - I adjust and correct many translations, although I don't think my quality is good nowadays. (By the way, you cannot find my name in credits.)
   - 我只更正了很多机翻，虽然从今天的角度来看，我的翻译质量也不是很行。（哦对了，在制作人员名单里你是找不到我的名字的。）
- [Pink Hour](http://store.steampowered.com/app/409670/)
   - Unfortunately, still no new update with my translation, and I have already lost my translation file :(
   - 很遗憾，至今未更新，我也丢失源翻译文件了.
- [Pink Heaven](http://store.steampowered.com/app/409690/)
   - Same as "Pink Hour"
   - 同上
- [Kero Blaster](http://store.steampowered.com/app/292500/)
- [GOCCO OF WAR](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346730/)
   - I have only translated some text in few update patches.
   - 只翻译过几次更新补丁。
- [Demon Slayer Akagi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551230/)
   - This indie game was developed by a friend of mine, and is also his first commercial game. I helped translate it into Simplified Chinese in my free time.
   - 我的一位朋友开发的独立游戏，同时也是他的第一部商业游戏。我在闲暇时候帮忙翻译成了简体中文。

**Fan translation/Simplified Chinese language patch: （民间简中汉化）**
- [Another Metroid 2 Remake aka AM2R](https://www.reddit.com/r/AM2R/)
   - I have never thought that I would make translation with decomplied source code/project and build Simplified Chinese version in Game Maker Studio 1.4. Fortunately, it is now an [open source project](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers) maintained by community and already added multi-language localization support.
   - 我从未想过我还会和反编译出来的项目文件以及GMS 1.4这个游戏引擎打交道，才完成游戏的完整汉化。值得庆幸的是现在AM2R也变成了由社区维护的[开源项目](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers)了，也支持多语言本地化。
- [Cube World](http://store.steampowered.com/app/1128000/)
   - I only have painful memory when we do community language patch for this game with other people (like [law4x](https://github.com/law4x) and get help from [ZaneYork](https://github.com/ZaneYork)), because it is really painful to do translation for this game, but seems this game is "dead" now. 
   - 痛苦，只能说痛苦，即便有其他的人的大力协助（上述英文描述里提到的人和社区志愿成员），做翻译补丁也是非常困难，不过好像游戏也凉了。
- Metroid: Samus Returns
   - By using [tools](https://github.com/TeamPBCN/Metroid-Samus-Returns) developed by TeamPBCN for their own "Metroid: Samus Returns" Chinese fans localization project.
   - 使用了PB汉化组为了汉化《密特罗德 萨姆斯归来》而开发并开源的[工具](https://github.com/TeamPBCN/Metroid-Samus-Returns)。
